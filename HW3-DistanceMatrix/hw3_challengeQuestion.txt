Data Mining 1 - HW3 Challenge Question

For the challenge question I decided to do some googling and look into scoring methods for clustering to determine performance.
There are many different measures to determine the clustering performance but one stuck out to me, the Calinski-Harabasz Index.

This index is also known as the Variance Ratio Criterion and can be described as the sum of between-clusters dispersion and
of inter-cluster dispersion. This concept can be computed in a single equation.

I feel as though this index would be extremely important in determining if clustering a particular dataset if valuable information.
A high score represents that the clusters are dense and well separated, which in turn validates that clustering is valuable.

Another advantage is that this is a fast computation and is would only require a complexity on O(N) since you'd only have to
loop through the dataset once. Calinski-Harabasz Index calculation would be a valuable tool to have in any clustering library.
