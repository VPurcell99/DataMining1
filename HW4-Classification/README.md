# Homework 5 - Classification

You can review the html for the 5 similarity matrices and the similarity matrix for all 5 combined.
Jupyter Notebook:     hw5_classification_jupyter.ipynb 
Jupyter NB HTML:      hw5_classification_jupyter.html
Raw Python Code:      hw3_classification.py
DecisionTree PDF:     titanic_decision_tree.pdf

The best classifier was the Nueral Net. To be fair that was only after I optimized the hidden layers for this data set. 
Before I did that Naive Bayes had the best accuracy

*NOTE* I provided the decision tree plot in a separate pdf because that allows for enough zoom so that it is readable. It does with microsoft edge pdf viewer.

Challenge Question:   For the challenge question I decided to implement another classification method. I implemented KNN using sklearn. 
	It is also in the jupyter nb. It did not have good accuracy though.
